                <p>After doing research looking at competitors' apps and seeing what they were offering in terms of features, what was most common between them, and our business goals (selling books), we decided how the MVP would look like. This had to include:

                <p>Having set up the  I started thinking about the user flow, exploring the most natural and easy way to explore the app.</p>
                <p>
                    I made many sketches, brainstorming all the ideas that came to mind together with the developer, this way together we could explore many different ways of displaying everything.  </p>
                <p>Sketching was a great way to define the user flow, the number of screens and how the user would interact with them.</p>
                <p> We were ready to move to start coding and designing the UI.</p>

                <p>I started doing low fidelity wireframes in sketch that evolved rapidly into a more comprehensive UI. With Sketch capabilities it was easy to iterate and try ideas.</p>
                <p>I wanted the UI to be very typographic, mainly black and white with just an accent colour. So I started designing everything black and white and then tried some colours.</p>
                    
                <p>I tried for it to be platform agnostic so it could work well in both android and IOS. For that I did a good research trying to find common elements in their guidelines.</p>  
                    
                <p>As soon as I had something I shared it with the developer via Zeplin so we could be developing and designing at the same time, checking how everything worked with real code in real devices as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>When we had the first working iteration of the app I tested it on 3 users, and one of them tested the app in 4 different devices.</p>

                <p>This usability testings were very useful as we confirmed the flow worked well with the users, they navigated without problems and the icons we were using also worked well. Also we found out some problems as the way the books were laid out (very close to the bottom of the page) made the users think there were more books and kept trying to scroll down to see more.</p>
                <p>Also we got valuable feedback from the users as how they were expecting to see the app blending with the notification bar in some devices, something I didn't considered at that point and we could see how long strings of text were behaving in small/large screens, so we had to change some font size to accommodate to all different screen sizes.</p>
                <p>After fixing everything we did a quick test with another person and we were confident that all was working ok now.</p>
