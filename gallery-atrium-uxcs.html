                <p>As their main way of recording inventory was paper, as soon as they started growing it became more and more difficult to manage all the portfolio of items. Items were sent to multiple places and third part locations and it was difficult to keep track of all the pieces, management involved a lot of calls between assistants, shop owners, printing, annotations and documents traveling. They reached us out to find a modern solution that would help them deal with this task.</p>

                <p>In order to get a better understanding of the problems, we decided the best way would be to observe how they were interacting with their actual inventory. We went to their shop to do some interviews and some shadowing.</p>
                <h4 class="text-primary">Interviews</h4>
                <p>We interviewedÂ shop owners and shop assistants to gain a general idea of the methodology they were using to manage the items and to understand their frustrations with the current system. Also we wanted to understand what they were expecting from the new system.</p>
                <h4 class="text-primary">Shadowing</h4>
                <p>To fully understand their interaction with the inventory and their business I spent some hours at the shop while they talked to customers, showed pieces, looked for prices, information, etc.

                <p>The information about the items was distributed between several paper folders and their laptop, such as extra information and pictures.</p>
                <p>They had duplicated information across shops and warehouses.</p>
                <p>The shop owners were always traveling and making business on the move. They showed pictures on their phone or Ipad to clients to offer items and often they had to call the assistants to get more detailed information.</p>
                <p>The same happened inside the shops, if I client asked for an item that wasn't physically present, they would show pictures on their laptops, and often had to check for more information in the paper folders.</p>

                <p>Based on those findings we had an idea of how the new inventory system would look like.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It will be hosted in the cloud to allow different people from different locations to access it</li>
                        <li>It will be fully responsible so it could be accessed seamlessly from any kind of device</li>
                        <li>
                            It had to be extremely easy to use as the users had been using paper because other tools looked too complicated (ie. Excel)</li>
                        <li>It won't just be an internal inventory system, it will serve as a way of showing a catalogue of items to prospective clients. Because of that, privacy was very important in terms of not showing sensitive information.

            <h4 class="text-primary">Design handover</h4>
            <p>The way we worked together was a mix of sending assets through Zeplin, pairing and implementing myself some design changes. We were in constant communication so we assesed what was the best way of handing over designs and implementing them.</p>
            <h4 class="text-primary">Client involvement</h4>
            <p>From day one the client was involved in the project, from helping with the research and understanding to giving feedback, doing testing etc. This was key to success as they were going to be the final user.

            <h4 class="text-primary">Understand information and actions</h4>
            <p>First we needed to understand all the information that was going to go in the form so I made a list with the shop's help. Also agreeing on the actions the user could do at this point. For the MVP, these were: search by any word, create new item, save, delete, edit.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-primary">Sketching basic layout and structure</h4>
            <p>To do that I started sketching ideas of the general look and sections, thinking how the interaction could be, with an eye in the requirement that some of the information should be kept hidden. We ended up with two options, one was using tabs and another with accordions.</p>
            <h4 class="text-primary">Wireframing - Prototype</h4>
            <p>As soon as we had a good idea of the structure I started wireframing in Sketch, putting together all the information, thinking how it would be presented and visualised. As soon as we had something that made sense to us we built an HTML prototype using bootstrap.</p>

                <p>There were many questions around the usability of the app, how to show and hide information, the best way to edit/save/delete and see if the collected data had everything they needed, and if it was useful to display in such way. So we decided to do a round of testing. I tested it on 3 subjects.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                
                <p>We ended up coding the prototype in Bootstrap because:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We needed to test how they client would be filling the form (so Invision like tools were too simplistic)</li>
                        <li>We wanted to save time in the development process. We could reuse parts of the prototype on the final product. (using Axure or more complex tools would take same time but wouldnât be reusable)</li>
                        <li>We both had very good experience coding using bootstrap so it made sense to use it.</li>

                <p>We were mainly interested in finding out how they would interact with the accordion and the tabs, if the labels and information prompted made sense for them and overall, if it was an easy task to just create new items, save and delete them. So I asked the users to input a new item. Then to find items and mark them as sold, to change the location of an item, etc. I also asked follow up questions to gain feedback.

                        <li>Also the way the information was presented needed some improvements, for example: the price was was too visible and needed to be hidden.</li>
                        <li>Some yes/no inputs werenât enough and needed a text field.</li>
                        <li>The tabs option didnât work as the admin part was too upfront and easy to click on, possibly revealing sensitive information in front of customers.</li>
